:spunion: **`ABOUT US`**

The :redose_full_a::redose_full_b::redose_full_c::redose_full_d: community fosters self-reflection, harm reduction, and recovery by providing a safe and comfortable place for visitors of all ages to discuss substance use, misuse, and various paths toward recovery if/when that time comes. 

We aim to provide an environment that is sufficiently inviting that people will hang around and benefit from good information provided either to them or others in the community amidst casual discourse. *re:dose* was founded in 2015 as public safety project of the nonprofit AJAr Foundation (https://ajar.org).

:spunion_pm: **`HARM REDUCTION`**

*The term "harm reduction" has become something of a meme among internet communities surrounding drug-related content, so we want you to know that we play things differently.* Our harm reduction services include a 24-hour live #ðŸ†˜ãƒ»support chat, as well as the safe and discreet distribution of physical resources like scales, clean equipment, reagent test kits, various accessories, and naloxone (NARCAN) as needed at no cost.

If you need any harm reduction materials, please email `distro@redose.org` or open a ticket here.

:spunion_am: **`TRIGGER WARNING`**

Try as we might to combat it, though we usually do succeed here, peer pressures and triggers toward substance use are things to be aware of. The nature of substance use in general makes it difficult to *completely* eliminate these issues if there are a lot of people gathering to discuss it (the same is true of AA or NA, as you might imagine).

If you are in recovery or just starting your recovery journey, then please do not feel bad for taking off for any period. If you get the vibe that this server is causing more harm than good in your life, we take feedback like that very seriously and want you to know that you can leave and return any time in the future with no roles lost.
